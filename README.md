# FreeRun üèÉ
A chrome extension that allows you to read runners world articles for free
## The Mission
If you're like me you've probably spent a lot of time consuming running content online. And just when you are starting to get interested
in an article, the "pay to continue" page pops up. Absolutely, the worst feeling of all time. So, I made this very simple 
Chrome extension to allow anyone to read runners world plus articles for Free! Currently I am waiting to be approved to the chrome webstore so feel free to clone this and load the extension directly. Cheers and happy running!
